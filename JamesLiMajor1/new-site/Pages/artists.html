                        <p><strong>Jackson Pollock</strong> was a “Action painter” and a leading figure of the Abstract Expressionist movement. Pollock revolutionized painting with his "drip" technique. Rather than using an easel, he laid his large canvases on the floor, pouring and splashing industrial paint on it.</p>
                        <p> "Action Painting" captured the raw energy of his physical movement, making the creation process just as important as the finished work. His chaotic, all-over compositions of drips and splashes reflect a deep, subconscious expression of emotion common for this movement and come to capture the iconic influence on modern art.</p>

                        <p><strong>Lee Krasner</strong> was a pioneer of Abstract Expressionism and the wife of Jackson Pollock. Her dynamic, large-scale works often employed a vigorous "action painting" style.</p>
                        <p>Her work is characterized by bold, gestural brushstrokes and a powerful use of color, including signature black, white, red, and green hues. For years, her talent was overshadowed by Pollock's fame, but she is now rightly celebrated for her innovative collages and her crucial role in the development of the New York  School.</p>

                        <p><strong>Barnett Newman</strong> was a master of "Color Field" painting, focused on large, flat areas of color. He sought to create profoundly spiritual and sublime experiences for the viewer. His most famous works feature vast, single-color canvases deliberately interrupted by vertical lines he  called "zips." These zips act as electrical charges, dividing the canvas and activating the color field. Newman’s goal was to overwhelm the  viewer, offering a moment of revelation and confronting them with the  sheer scale and power of color itself.</p>
                        <p><strong>Rothko:</strong> Though often categorized as a Color Field painter, Mark Rothko rejected  labels, insisting his work was deeply human and emotional. His iconic  style features soft-edged, luminous rectangles of saturated color  stacked and floating against a background. Rothko intended these hazy,  glowing blocks to envelop the viewer, provoking raw, basic human  emotions like tragedy, ecstasy, and doom. He was deeply affected by the  horrors of World War II and saw his art as a modern form of myth-making, creating a silent, meditative space for profound contemplation.</p>
                        <p><strong>Willem de Kooning</strong> was a central figure in the Action Painting branch. Famous for his intensely energetic and chaotic canvases. Unlike his  purely abstract peers, he famously returned to the human figure, most  notoriously in his aggressive and visceral Woman series. His  style combined frenetic, gestural brushstrokes with spots of bold color, creating a sense of structured chaos. De Kooning's work embodies the  movement's ethos of grappling with inner angst and emotion, balancing  abstraction with recognizable forms in a powerful and often disquieting  way.</p>

                        <p>Many artists in the movement were influenced by famous psychologists such as Carl Jung and his theory of the subconscious mind, which suggested that people have a subconscious schema formed as a response to their experiences. Other major contributions include the art movements of Surrealism and Cubism.</p>
                        <p><strong>Surrealism</strong> was an art movement with major characteristics being unexpected combinations of subject matter and nonsensical or absurd storylines. <strong>Cubism</strong> was another art movement that depicted subjects with broken-up geometric forms in an abstract manner. All of these influences showed themselves in the works of the Abstract expressionists, which can be characterized as chaotic, nonsensical, rebellious, and intensely emotional.</p>
                        <p>Many praised the work, but it also generated a large amount of criticism as well and was highly polarizing. Though Abstract Expressionism as a major movement died out in the 60s, it remained highly influential in the works that followed. </p>
