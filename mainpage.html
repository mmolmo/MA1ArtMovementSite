      <h3>What is it? A Brief History</h3>
      <p>Abstract expressionism is an American Art movement originating in New York City in the 1940s. Artists in this movement were affected by the horror of World War II and rejected painting human subjects in favor of an abstract style. In response to the tragedy, these artists created the movement as an exploration of pouring raw emotions and feelings onto the canvas.

     <div class="bottomtextcontainer">
       <span class="text">Many artists in the movement were influenced by famous psychologists such as <span class="emphasized">Carl Jung</span> and his theory of the subconscious mind, which suggested that people have a subconscious schema formed as a response to their experiences. Other major contributions include the art movements of <span class="emphasized">Surrealism</span> and <span class="emphasized">Cubism</span>. <span class="emphasized">Surrealism</span> was an art movement with major characteristics being unexpected combinations of subject matter and nonsensical or absurd storylines. <span class="emphasized">Cubism</span> was another art movement that depicted subjects with broken-up geometric forms in an abstract manner. All of these influences showed themselves in the works of the Abstract expressionists, which can be characterized as chaotic, nonsensical, rebellious, and intensely emotional.</span>
